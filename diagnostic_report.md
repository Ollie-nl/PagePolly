# PagePolly Backend Service Diagnostic Report
Date: 2025-05-14

## Executive Summary
All backend services are currently experiencing 503 Service Unavailable errors across all endpoints. The issue appears to be systemic and affects both the main API and crawling services.

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Configuration Analysis

#### Critical Issues:
- Missing Supabase credentials reference in db.js
- Timeout settings may be too short in API client
- Missing retry mechanisms for failed requests
- Incomplete error handling in API client

#### Server Setup:
✓ Basic Express server setup appears correct
✓ Supabase client properly imported
✗ Potential CORS configuration issues

### 2. API Endpoint Testing Results

All tested endpoints consistently return 503 errors:
- /api/reports
- /api/scrapingbee/health
- /api/crawls/test
- /api/crawls/api/crawls/status

Key Observations:
- All endpoints return HTML error pages instead of JSON responses
- Increased timeouts (5s, 10s, 30s) did not resolve the issue
- Issue persists across all service endpoints

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issues:
1. Server Availability
   - The server is responding but returning 503 errors
   - HTML error pages suggest a proxy/load balancer issue

2. Connection Problems
   - Missing retry mechanisms
   - Inadequate timeout configurations
   - Potential DNS or routing issues

3. Configuration Issues
   - Incomplete Supabase setup
   - Missing error handling
   - CORS configuration problems

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. Server Infrastructure:
   - Verify server process is running correctly
   - Check server resources (CPU, memory, network)
   - Review load balancer configuration
   - Inspect proxy settings

2. Application Configuration:
   - Implement retry mechanism with exponential backoff
   - Add proper error interceptors
   - Increase timeout values
   - Configure proper CORS settings

3. Monitoring & Debugging:
   - Add detailed logging
   - Implement health check endpoints
   - Set up monitoring alerts
   - Add request tracing

### Long-term Improvements:
1. Implement circuit breaker pattern
2. Add service discovery
3. Improve error handling
4. Set up automated health checks
5. Implement proper monitoring

## Implementation Priority

1. High Priority (Immediate):
   - Fix server availability issues
   - Implement retry mechanisms
   - Add proper error handling

2. Medium Priority (This Week):
   - Add monitoring
   - Implement health checks
   - Configure proper timeouts

3. Low Priority (Next Sprint):
   - Implement circuit breaker
   - Add service discovery
   - Set up automated testing

## Next Steps
1. Review and implement immediate actions
2. Set up monitoring and alerts
3. Test fixes in staging environment
4. Deploy to production with rollback plan
5. Monitor for 24-48 hours post-deployment
